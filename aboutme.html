        I am a sophomore Computer Science major from Warren, CT. I am living off campus 
        this year with five of my friends. I enjoy playing all sorts of sports, and work 
        at a golf course in the summer. I am a part of Greek Life here at the University 
        of Rhode Island. For high school, I attended Wamogo Regional High School, a public
        high school that took students from three seperate towns, and which also had an 
        agricultural program, which took in students from six additional towns.
